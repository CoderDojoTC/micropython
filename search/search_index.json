A microcontrollers is a small low-cost computer used to control physical devices such as LED, servos and motors. Microcontroller boards typically cost around $4 to $6 and are an ideal way to learn about computer science because you can use them to build fun projects. For example you can control a row of LEDs, move a robot and sense the world around us with a variety of light, sound and motion sensors. In the past, microcontrollers were difficult for younger students to program. They were also too expensive for every student to purchase and take home. A typical Arduino kit could easily cost over $20 and required you to learn C to program it. Today, microcontrollsers such as the Raspberry Pi Pico and the ESP32 cost as little as two dollars. And these devices are designed to be programmed in Python, the most popular programming language for students. What is Physical Computing? \u00b6 Physical Computing is a field of study that can sense and respond to the world around us. Unlike programming a cell phone or a laptop computer, our focus is reading sensor values and quickly responding to changes. Physical Computing is widely used to teach principals of computer science because students can create their own projects and express creativity such a controlling the patterns of lights or creating complex sounds. How Microcontrollsers are Used \u00b6 Microcontrollers do three things: They read sensor values of the world around them They transform this data into useful representations They send outputs to devices that control the world such as LEDs and motors as well as displays Here is a general diagram to think about when you are designing microcontroller systems: Here is a specific example instance of what inputs and outputs might do. Programming a Microcontroller \u00b6 In this class, we will use the MicroPython to program our Microcontrollers. Our programs will usually have the following structure: Imports: Specify the right Python libraries Setup: Setup initial data structures Main loop: Continuously monitor inputs and take actions The following is a small example of this code in Micropython: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # Import Section import machine import time # Setup Section led = machine . Pin ( 16 , machine . Pin . OUT ) # Main Loop while True : led . high () time . sleep ( 0.5 ) led . low () time . sleep ( 0.5 ) Almost all our programs will start with the import machine line. This tells the system that we need to gather all the libraries that understand our physical machine.","title":"Microcontrollers"},{"location":"01a-microcontrollers/#microcontrollers","text":"This lesson is an overview of microcontrollers and their role in teaching [physical computing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing).

There are two common versions: SSD1306 - this is the most popular and versatile. It can be used to drive many different types and sizes of OLEDs. The SSD1306 can be used with both the simple 4 wire I2C interface as well as the slightly faster 7 wire SPI interface. These devices have only four wires labeled VCC, GND, SDA and SCL. SDA is for data and SCL is for the clock. 2, SH1106 - this is less popular version and supports the 4-wire I2C interface. I2C Scanner \u00b6 Because your microcontroller might have multiple displays on it, their must be some way to address the devices using an address. Most of the devices come with a default address of decimal value 60 (hex value X3C). To test this the i3c module has a i2c scan function. 1 2 3 4 5 import machine sda = machine . Pin ( 0 ) scl = machine . Pin ( 1 ) i2c = machine . I2C ( 0 , sda = sda , scl = scl , freq = 400000 ) print ( \"Device found at decimal\" , i2c . scan ()) returns: [60] Using the SSD1306 with I2C Interfaces \u00b6 Add the ssd1306 Python Module \u00b6 You can now use the Thonny \"Tools -> Manage Packages...\" menu to add the Python driver for the SSD1306 device.

The SSD1306 only has 128x64 pixel. The SPI interface \u00b6 The four wire I2C interface is great for kids that don't want to hook up more than four wires. But there are times when we want a higher performance screen with faster refresh times. This is when the SPI interface comes in handy. The seven wires on the back of the SPI OLED screens are the following as read from the top to bottom looking at the back of the display: CS - Chip Select - pin 4 DC - Data/Command - pin 5 RES - Reset - pin 6 SDA - Data - SPIO TX GP7 pin 10 SCL - Clock - Connect to SPIO SCK GP6 pin 9 VCC - Connect to the 3.3V Out pin 36 GND - pin 38 or 3 any other GND pin Pico Pins \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Sample code sections 28 # ------------ SPI ------------------ 29 # Pin Map SPI 30 # - 3v - xxxxxx - Vcc 31 # - G - xxxxxx - Gnd 32 # - D7 - GPIO 13 - Din / MOSI fixed 33 # - D5 - GPIO 14 - Clk / Sck fixed 34 # - D8 - GPIO 4 - CS (optional, if the only connected device) 35 # - D2 - GPIO 5 - D/C 36 # - D1 - GPIO 2 - Res SCK is the clock - hook this to the oled SCL MOSI is the line taking data from your Pico to the peripheral device.

Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over its serial connection. With ampy you can send files from your computer to the board's file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python script to a board to be executed. Note that ampy by design is meant to be simple and does not support advanced interaction like a shell or terminal to send input to a board. Check out other MicroPython tools like rshell or mpfshell for more advanced interaction with boards. Analog to Digital Converter \u00b6 A component that takes an analogue signal and changes it to a digital one. Every ADC has two parameters, its resolution , measured in digital bits, and its channels , or how many analogue signals it can accept and convert at once. Also know as: ADC BOOTSEL \u00b6 A button on the pico that when pressed during power up will allow you to mount the device as a USB device. Also known as: Boot Selection Castellated Edge \u00b6 Plated through holes or vias located in the edges of a printed circuit board that make it easier to solder onto another circuit board. The word \"Castellated\" means having grooves or slots on an edge and is derived from the turrets of a castle. ESP32 \u00b6 A series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. Typical costs for the ESP32 is Sample on eBay $5 Sample on Amazon $11 Sample on Sparkfun $21 ESP32 Quick Reference Framebuffer \u00b6 A region of your microcontroller RAM that stores a bitmap image of your display. For a 128X64 monochrome display this would be 128 * 64 = 8,192 bits or 1,024 bytes (1K). Color displays must store up to 8 bytes per color for each color (red, green and blue). Wikipedia page on Framebuffer Micropython \u00b6 A set of Python libraries and tools developed specifically for microcontrollers. Micropython was originally developed by Damien George and first released in 2014. It includes many of the features of mainstream Python, while adding a range of new ones designed to take advantage of the facilities available on Raspberry Pi Pico and other microcontroller boards like the ESP32. MPG Shell \u00b6 A simple micropython shell based file explorer for ESP8266 and WiPy Micropython based devices. The shell is a helper for up/downloading files to the ESP8266 (over serial line and Websockets) and WiPy (serial line and telnet). It basically offers commands to list and upload/download files on the flash FS of the device. GitHub Repo for MPFShell Raspberry Pi Foundation \u00b6 The company that builds the Raspberry Pi hardware and provides some software. Raspberry Pi Pico \u00b6 A microcontroller designed by the Raspberry Pi foundation for doing real-time control systems. The Pico was introduces in 2020 with a retail list price of $4. It was a key development because it used a custom chip that had 100 times the RAM of an Arduino Nano. Pico Pinout \u00b6 The Pico pinout has Pinout PDF RP2040 chip \u00b6 A custom chip created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to power the Raspberry Pi Pico . rshell \u00b6 A simple micropython shell which runs on the host and uses MicroPython's raw-REPL to send python snippets to the pyboard in order to get filesystem information, and to copy files to and from MicroPython's filesystem. It also has the ability to invoke the regular REPL, so rshell can be used as a terminal emulator as well. Note: With rshell you can disable USB Mass Storage and still copy files into and out of your pyboard.
