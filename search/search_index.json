A microcontrollers is a small low-cost computer used to control physical devices such as LED, servos and motors. Microcontroller boards typically cost around $4 to $6 and are an ideal way to learn about computer science because you can use them to build fun projects. For example you can control a row of LEDs, move a robot and sense the world around us with a variety of light, sound and motion sensors. In the past, microcontrollers were difficult for younger students to program. They were also too expensive for every student to purchase and take home. A typical Arduino kit could easily cost over $20 and required you to learn C to program it. Today, microcontrollsers such as the Raspberry Pi Pico and the ESP32 cost as little as two dollars. And these devices are designed to be programmed in Python, the most popular programming language for students. What is Physical Computing? \u00b6 Physical Computing is a field of study that can sense and respond to the world around us. Unlike programming a cell phone or a laptop computer, our focus is reading sensor values and quickly responding to changes. Physical Computing is widely used to teach principals of computer science because students can create their own projects and express creativity such a controlling the patterns of lights or creating complex sounds. How Microcontrollsers are Used \u00b6 Microcontrollers do three things: They read sensor values of the world around them They transform this data into useful representations They send outputs to devices that control the world such as LEDs and motors as well as displays Here is a general diagram to think about when you are designing microcontroller systems: Here is a specific example instance of what inputs and outputs might do. Programming a Microcontroller \u00b6 In this class, we will use the MicroPython to program our Microcontrollers. Our programs will usually have the following structure: Imports: Specify the right Python libraries Setup: Setup initial data structures Main loop: Continuously monitor inputs and take actions The following is a small example of this code in Micropython: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # Import Section import machine import time # Setup Section led = machine . Pin ( 16 , machine . Pin . OUT ) # Main Loop while True : led . high () time . sleep ( 0.5 ) led . low () time . sleep ( 0.5 ) Almost all our programs will start with the import machine line. This tells the system that we need to gather all the libraries that understand our physical machine.","title":"Microcontrollers"},{"location":"01a-microcontrollers/#microcontrollers","text":"This lesson is an overview of microcontrollers and their role in teaching [physical computing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing).

With the arrival of the ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi Pico this has all changed. These microcontrollers have around 100 times that RAM - typically around 200K bytes. So we are integrating low-cost OLED displays into many of our CoderDojo projects! Display Types \u00b6 There are four main types of display technology that use for small microcontrollers. LED - Light Emitting Diode - these are often low-resolution but have larger area. The start with single color displays but there are also multi-color LED strips and LED matrix displays. OLED - Organic Light Emitting Diode - small low-cost and high-contrast monochrome displays used in watches. LCD - Liquid Crystal Display - many of these are monochrome displays that must have precise power to get consistent contrast. TFT - Thin Film Transistor - a type of LCD that are used for larger color screens. 240X240 TFT Display Full Color LCD TFT Display SPI HD 65K Module ST7735 Concepts \u00b6 Before you begin to use these displays, there are a few things to understand to use them effectively. Based on your project needs, you can use this knowledge to find the right solution for you. Framebuffers \u00b6 A framebuffer is a copy of the display information that is resident within the RAM of the microcontroller. It must be as large as the display. For a 128X64 monochrome display this would be 128 * 64 = 8192 bits or 1,024 bytes (1K). A full color 240X240 TFT which uses 8 bits for red, green and blue would require 3 X 8 X 240 X 240 = 1,382,400 bits or 172K bytes. Not all all displays need framebuffers. Some displays can take a series of vector drawing commands such as \"draw line\" and \"draw text\". These displays can be useful if you don't have a large amount of RAM. Display Chip Types \u00b6 There are two common versions: SSD1306 - This is the most popular and versatile chip. It can be used to drive many different types and sizes of OLEDs. The SSD1306 can be used with both the simple 4 wire I2C interface as well as the slightly faster 7 wire SPI interface. These devices have only four wires labeled VCC, GND, SDA and SCL. SDA is for data and SCL is for the clock. SH1106 - This is less popular version and supports the 4-wire I2C interface. ST7735 - This chip is used on larger color TFT displays. You can usually look on the back of the display device and see what type of check controls your OLED display. Communication Protocols \u00b6 In addition to the multiple types of displays and types of chips driving the displays, there are also two options on how you want to communicate between your microcontroller and the display. I2C - This is the most common type and only requires two wires beside power and ground. Us this as your default unless you display does not support it. SPI - This is a more complex interface and requires up to seven wires. Some devices only support SPI interfaces. Basic Draw Functions \u00b6 For our beginning labs we will just do some basic drawing. We will start out with just four functions: Initialize the display framebuffer memory with the right object class initialization Fill the framebuffer will zeros which are black pixels with the oled.fill(0) Draw white text in the framebuffer memory with the oled.text(\"Hello World!\", 40, 10) Send the entire framebuffer to the display over the bus with the oled.show() function. Initializing the Framebuffer \u00b6 Let's assume that we have a four wire OLED that uses the popular SSD1306 chip with 128X64 pixels. We call our oled \"oled\" using the following line: 1 2 from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C oled = SSD1306_I2C ( 128 , 64 , i2c ) Function Description Parameters oled.fill(0) Fill the display with white or black 0=black and 1=white oled.text(\"Hello\", Draw text String, x (horizontal from left edge) and y (vertical from the top)Example: Draw \"Hello World\" 40 over and 10 down. oled.text(\"Hello World!\", 40, 10) show Show the display Send the current frame buffer to the display. You must do this after you make and changes to the Framebuffer. The full program would look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C oled = SSD1306_I2C ( 128 , 64 , i2c ) oled . fill ( 0 ) oled . text ( \"Hello World!\" , 0 , 0 ) oled . show () This would display the following: Full list of Drawing Functions \u00b6 Every drawing library might have slightly different functions. But we can quickly see the functions that we want by using the dir() function on the SSD1306_I2C class. 1 2 from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C print ( dir ( SSD1306_I2C )) This returns the following list: 1 2 3 4 5 [ '__class__' , '__init__' , '__module__' , '__name__' , '__qualname__' , '__bases__' , '__dict__' , 'blit' , 'fill' , 'fill_rect' , 'hline' , 'invert' , 'line' , 'pixel' , 'rect' , 'scroll' , 'text' , 'vline' , 'init_display' , 'write_cmd' , 'show' , 'poweroff' , 'poweron' , 'contrast' , 'write_data' ] Technically, these are called methods of the SSD1306_I2C class.

They are easy to connect via SPI. Just four wires: GND, VCC, Clock and Data. They have a large area to display feedback. Most of them are 128X64 pixels. Once you get the drivers installed (not always easy) they are easy to program . You only need to initialize the device and run the oled.fill(), oled.text() and oled.show() functions. OLEDs, unlike LCDs, have high contrast over a large range of input voltages . This means that as your batteries slowly discharge, your OLEDs will keep their high-quality contrast. There is plenty of sample code and tutorials available. The first step is to find out what type of display graphics chip is used in your OLED.","title":"OLED SSD1306 Examples"},{"location":"11-oled-ssd1306-spi/#i2c-scanner","text":"Because your microcontroller might have multiple displays on it, their must be some way to address the devices using an address.

Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over its serial connection. With ampy you can send files from your computer to the board's file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python script to a board to be executed. Note that ampy by design is meant to be simple and does not support advanced interaction like a shell or terminal to send input to a board. Check out other MicroPython tools like rshell or mpfshell for more advanced interaction with boards. Analog to Digital Converter \u00b6 A component that takes an analogue signal and changes it to a digital one. Every ADC has two parameters, its resolution , measured in digital bits, and its channels , or how many analogue signals it can accept and convert at once. Also know as: ADC BOOTSEL \u00b6 A button on the pico that when pressed during power up will allow you to mount the device as a USB device. Also known as: Boot Selection Castellated Edge \u00b6 Plated through holes or vias located in the edges of a printed circuit board that make it easier to solder onto another circuit board. The word \"Castellated\" means having grooves or slots on an edge and is derived from the turrets of a castle. ESP32 \u00b6 A series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. Typical costs for the ESP32 is Sample on eBay $5 Sample on Amazon $11 Sample on Sparkfun $21 ESP32 Quick Reference Framebuffer \u00b6 A region of your microcontroller RAM that stores a bitmap image of your display. For a 128X64 monochrome display this would be 128 * 64 = 8,192 bits or 1,024 bytes (1K). Color displays must store up to 8 bytes per color for each color (red, green and blue). Wikipedia page on Framebuffer I2C \u00b6 A communications protocol common in microcontroller-based systems, particularly for interfacing with sensors, memory devices and liquid crystal displays. I2C is similar to SPI, it's a synchronous protocol because it uses a clock line. Also Known as: Inter-integrated Circuit See also: SPI Micropython \u00b6 A set of Python libraries and tools developed specifically for microcontrollers. Micropython was originally developed by Damien George and first released in 2014. It includes many of the features of mainstream Python, while adding a range of new ones designed to take advantage of the facilities available on Raspberry Pi Pico and other microcontroller boards like the ESP32. See also: CircuitPython MPG Shell \u00b6 A simple micropython shell based file explorer for ESP8266 and WiPy Micropython based devices. The shell is a helper for up/downloading files to the ESP8266 (over serial line and Websockets) and WiPy (serial line and telnet). It basically offers commands to list and upload/download files on the flash FS of the device. GitHub Repo for MPFShell Raspberry Pi Foundation \u00b6 The company that builds the Raspberry Pi hardware and provides some software. Raspberry Pi Pico \u00b6 A microcontroller designed by the Raspberry Pi foundation for doing real-time control systems. The Pico was introduces in 2020 with a retail list price of $4. It was a key development because it used a custom chip that had 100 times the RAM of an Arduino Nano. Pico Pinout \u00b6 The Pico pinout has Pinout PDF RP2040 chip \u00b6 A custom chip created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to power the Raspberry Pi Pico . rshell \u00b6 A simple micropython shell which runs on the host and uses MicroPython's raw-REPL to send python snippets to the pyboard in order to get filesystem information, and to copy files to and from MicroPython's filesystem. It also has the ability to invoke the regular REPL, so rshell can be used as a terminal emulator as well. Note: With rshell you can disable USB Mass Storage and still copy files into and out of your pyboard. RShell GitHub Repo SPI \u00b6 An interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals such as sensors, displays and SD cards. SPI uses separate clock and data lines, along with a select line to choose the device you wish to talk to. Also known as: Serial Peripheral Interface See also: I2C Thonny \u00b6 A lightweight Python IDE ideal for writing simple Python programs for first time users. Thonny runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. Thonny web site UF2 File \u00b6 The file that must be uploaded into the Raspberry Pi Pico folder to allow it to be used. The file name format looks like this: rp2-pico-20210205-unstable-v1.14-8-g1f800cac3.uf2 Unicorn \u00b6 MicroPython on Unicorn is completely open source Micropython emulator Github Repo: https://github.com/micropython/micropython-unicorn","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#micropython-glossary-of-terms","text":"","title":"Micropython Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"glossary/#ampy","text":"A micropython command line utility to interact with a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over a serial connection.
