A microcontrollers is a small low-cost computer used to control physical devices such as LED, servos and motors. Microcontroller boards typically cost around $4 to $6 and are an ideal way to learn about computer science because you can use them to build fun projects. For example you can control a row of LEDs, move a robot and sense the world around us with a variety of light, sound and motion sensors. In the past, microcontrollers were difficult for younger students to program. They were also too expensive for every student to purchase and take home. A typical Arduino kit could easily cost over $20 and required you to learn C to program it. Today, microcontrollsers such as the Raspberry Pi Pico and the ESP32 cost as little as two dollars. And these devices are designed to be programmed in Python, the most popular programming language for students. What is Physical Computing? Physical Computing is a field of study that can sense and respond to the world around us. Unlike programming a cell phone or a laptop computer, our focus is reading sensor values and quickly responding to changes. Physical Computing is widely used to teach principals of computer science because students can create their own projects and express creativity such a controlling the patterns of lights or creating complex sounds. How Microcontrollsers are Used Microcontrollers do three things: They read sensor values of the world around them They transform this data into useful representations They send outputs to devices that control the world such as LEDs and motors as well as displays Here is a general diagram to think about when you are designing microcontroller systems: Here is a specific example instance of what inputs and outputs might do. Programming a Microcontroller In this class, we will use the MicroPython to program our Microcontrollers. Our programs will usually have the following structure: Imports: Specify the right Python libraries Setup: Setup initial data structures Main loop: Continuously monitor inputs and take actions The following is a small example of this code in Micropython: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # Import Section import machine import time # Setup Section led = machine . Pin ( 16 , machine . Pin . OUT ) # Main Loop while True : led . high () time . sleep ( 0.5 ) led . low () time . sleep ( 0.5 ) Almost all our programs will start with the import machine line. This tells the system that we need to gather all the libraries that understand our physical machine.","title":"Microcontrollers"},{"location":"01a-microcontrollers/#microcontrollers","text":"This lesson is an overview of microcontrollers and their role in teaching [physical computing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing).

You can purchase USB Micro-B to USB-A or USB-C (Mac) cables on e-bay for under $2 or for $5 at Microcenter. - image from ebay Pico Pinout The pinout diagram for the Raspberry Pi Pico is shown below. It features: * 26 \u00d7 multi-function GPIO pins * 2 \u00d7 SPI, 2 \u00d7 I2C, 2 \u00d7 UART, 3 \u00d7 12-bit ADC, 16 \u00d7 controllable PWM Raspberry Pi Pico\u2019s 40 pins with pin 1 in the upper right corner with the USB connector at the top. The pin numbers are incremented as you go counterclockwise around the board. You go down the left side and then continue up on the right side until you get to pin 40 in the upper right corner. When you program the Pico, you use the machine.Pin() but you always use the GP* number, never the pin number on the board pin numbers. The diagram above shows the top view where pins 1, 2 and 40 are printed next to the pins. Pico Pinout Datasheet PDF Next to each pin is the primary label of what the pin does. Pins 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33 and 38 with the black background are all GND pins. Pins are numbered 0-29, and 26-29 have ADC capabilities Pin IO modes are: Pin.IN, Pin.OUT, Pin.ALT Pin pull modes are: Pin.PULL_UP, Pin.PULL_DOWN Label Name Description V3 3.3 volts power A source of 3.3 V power, the same voltage your Pico runs at internally, generated from the VSYS input. This power supply can be switched on and off using the 3V3_EN pin above it, which also switches your Pico off. VSYS ~2-5 volts power A pin directly connected to your Pico\u2019s internal power supply, which cannot be switched off without also switching Pico off. VBUS 5 volts power A source of 5 V power taken from your Pico\u2019s micro USB port, and used to power hardware which needs more than 3.3 V. GND 0 volts ground A ground connection, used to complete a circuit connected to a power source. Several of these pins are dotted around your Pico to make wiring easier.

With the arrival of the ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi Pico this has all changed. These microcontrollers have around 100 times that RAM - typically around 200K bytes. So we are integrating low-cost OLED displays into many of our CoderDojo projects! Display Types There are four main types of display technology that use for small microcontrollers. LED - Light Emitting Diode - these are often low-resolution but have larger area. The start with single color displays but there are also multi-color LED strips and LED matrix displays. OLED - Organic Light Emitting Diode - small low-cost and high-contrast monochrome displays used in watches. LCD - Liquid Crystal Display - many of these are monochrome displays that must have precise power to get consistent contrast. TFT - Thin Film Transistor - a type of LCD that are used for larger color screens. 240X240 TFT Display Full Color LCD TFT Display SPI HD 65K Module ST7735 Concepts Before you begin to use these displays, there are a few things to understand to use them effectively. Based on your project needs, you can use this knowledge to find the right solution for you. Framebuffers A framebuffer is a copy of the display information that is resident within the RAM of the microcontroller. It must be as large as the display. For a 128X64 monochrome display this would be 128 * 64 = 8192 bits or 1,024 bytes (1K). A full color 240X240 TFT which uses 8 bits for red, green and blue would require 3 X 8 X 240 X 240 = 1,382,400 bits or 172K bytes. Not all all displays need framebuffers. Some displays can take a series of vector drawing commands such as \"draw line\" and \"draw text\". These displays can be useful if you don't have a large amount of RAM. Display Chip Types There are two common versions: SSD1306 - This is the most popular and versatile chip. It can be used to drive many different types and sizes of OLEDs. The SSD1306 can be used with both the simple 4 wire I2C interface as well as the slightly faster 7 wire SPI interface. These devices have only four wires labeled VCC, GND, SDA and SCL. SDA is for data and SCL is for the clock. SH1106 - This is less popular version and supports the 4-wire I2C interface. ST7735 - This chip is used on larger color TFT displays. You can usually look on the back of the display device and see what type of check controls your OLED display. Communication Protocols In addition to the multiple types of displays and types of chips driving the displays, there are also two options on how you want to communicate between your microcontroller and the display. I2C - This is the most common type and only requires two wires beside power and ground. Us this as your default unless you display does not support it. The original specification of I2C had a communication speed of 100K bits per second. Many systems can be run at 400K per second. SPI - This is a more complex interface and requires up to seven wires. Some devices only support SPI interfaces. SPI typically runs around 1M bits/second although it can go up to 10M bits/second in some applications. SPI is ideal when you want to transfer a large amount of display data to a screen quickly. Basic Draw Functions For our beginning labs we will just do some basic drawing. We will start out with just four functions: Initialize the display framebuffer memory with the right object class initialization Fill the framebuffer will zeros which are black pixels with the oled.fill(0) Draw white text in the framebuffer memory with the oled.text(\"Hello World!\", 40, 10) Send the entire framebuffer to the display over the bus with the oled.show() function. Initializing the Framebuffer Let's assume that we have a four wire OLED that uses the popular SSD1306 chip with 128X64 pixels. We call our oled \"oled\" using the following line: 1 2 from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C oled = SSD1306_I2C ( 128 , 64 , i2c ) Function Description Parameters oled.fill(0) Fill the display with white or black 0=black and 1=white oled.text(\"Hello\", Draw text String, x (horizontal from left edge) and y (vertical from the top)Example: Draw \"Hello World\" 40 over and 10 down. oled.text(\"Hello World!\", 40, 10) show Show the display Send the current frame buffer to the display. You must do this after you make and changes to the Framebuffer. The full program would look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C oled = SSD1306_I2C ( 128 , 64 , i2c ) oled . fill ( 0 ) oled . text ( \"Hello World!\" , 0 , 0 ) oled . show () This would display the following: Full list of Drawing Functions Every drawing library might have slightly different functions. But we can quickly see the functions that we want by using the dir() function on the SSD1306_I2C class. 1 2 from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C print ( dir ( SSD1306_I2C )) This returns the following list: 1 2 3 4 5 [ '__class__' , '__init__' , '__module__' , '__name__' , '__qualname__' , '__bases__' , '__dict__' , 'blit' , 'fill' , 'fill_rect' , 'hline' , 'invert' , 'line' , 'pixel' , 'rect' , 'scroll' , 'text' , 'vline' , 'init_display' , 'write_cmd' , 'show' , 'poweroff' , 'poweron' , 'contrast' , 'write_data' ] Technically, these are called methods of the SSD1306_I2C class. The ones that begin and end with double underscores are class methods for creating new object instances. The rest of the items on the list are the drawing functions. The following are relevant for the SSD1306_I2C display. The display has (0,0) in the upper left corner. X is horizontal (width) and Y is vertical (height). The state is 0=off (black) and 1=on (white).

Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over its serial connection. With ampy you can send files from your computer to the board's file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python script to a board to be executed. Note that ampy by design is meant to be simple and does not support advanced interaction like a shell or terminal to send input to a board. Check out other MicroPython tools like rshell or mpfshell for more advanced interaction with boards.

They are easy to connect via SPI. Just four wires: GND, VCC, Clock and Data. They have a large area to display feedback. Most of them are 128X64 pixels. Once you get the drivers installed (not always easy) they are easy to program . You only need to initialize the device and run the oled.fill(), oled.text() and oled.show() functions. OLEDs, unlike LCDs, have high contrast over a large range of input voltages . This means that as your batteries slowly discharge, your OLEDs will keep their high-quality contrast. There is plenty of sample code and tutorials available. You can program them with Python (our student's favorite language) They are crazy fun! The first step is to find out what type of display graphics chip is used in your OLED. In these lessons we will assume you have a 128X64 or similar OLED display. Many of these displays can be purchased for around $4 on eBay. Many of these displays use the popular SSD1306 chip to drive the displays. There are also to communication options: I2C - simple 2 wire connection (not including power and ground) SPI - five wires but also faster screen refresh rates Updating a 128X64 display using I2C takes around 37ms. When using the SPI interface, updating the display can be reduced to around 2.79ms. These labs will assume these parameters, but you can modify the labs to use different sizes and display driver chips by only modifying a few lines of code. I2C Scanner Because your microcontroller might have multiple displays on it, their must be some way to address the devices using an address. Most of the devices come with a default address of decimal value 60 (hex value X3C). To test this the i3c module has a i2c scan function. 1 2 3 4 5 import machine sda = machine .

They are easy to connect via SPI. Just four wires: GND, VCC, Clock and Data. They have a large area to display feedback. Most of them are 128X64 pixels. Once you get the drivers installed (not always easy) they are easy to program . You only need to initialize the device and run the oled.fill(), oled.text() and oled.show() functions.

These digital signals that quickly switch between zero and a positive voltage like 3.3 or 5 volts. However, they are not designed to create \"analog\" output of a continuous varying voltage. However, we can use a technique called \"Pulse Width Modulation\" to simulate the various frequencies of sound using digital only outputs. Pulse Width Modulation is the process of changing not the height of a electrical signal, but the width between the pulses of digital signals. By changing the distance of the spaces between the digital signals we can generate a signal that will sound like it has a higher or lower frequency or pitch. MicroPython provides a powerful library of tools for you to easily generate pulses of different shapes. This is called the PWM library. Will will use this in our sound and music programs. Here is a sample of how this is called in our code: Duty Cycle The Duty Cycle is what percent of time a pulse is high. For working with sound, we want to generate smooth sound waves that are on 1/2 of the time and off 1/2 of the time. So our duty cycles will be set to be 50%. On the Raspberry Pi Pico we can achieve this by the following function: 1 speaker.duty_u16(1000) When we are done playing a tone, we must always explicitly turn the duty cycle back to 0. 1 speaker.duty_u16(0) If we forget to add this line, the tone will continue to play despite the main program stopping. This shows you that the part of the chip that generates the tone pulses is an independent processor that is not dependant on the main program running! 1 2 from machine import Pin , PWM from utime import sleep Note that we will also need to pause between notes, so will use the sleep library to pause execution of our sound generation.
