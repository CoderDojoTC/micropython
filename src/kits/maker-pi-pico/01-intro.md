# Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 Kits

There are to types of kits that we provide to your coding clubs.  The base kits have just the main Cytron Maker Pi PR2040 board and some sensors.  These base kits are ideal for clubs that don't allow students to solder in their buildings.  Other kits include the SmartCar Robot chassis, motors and a battery pack for building a collision avoidance robot.  These kits require some light soldering: two wires for each motor and two wires for the power switch.

Because of the way we deliver these kit, our Maker Pi RP2040 materials are divided into two sections:

1. Section 1 (this part) assumes you just have the main Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 board and a Micro USB cable.  This section includes labs on using the LEDs, NeoPixels, buttons and sound.
2. [Section 2](../MAKER-PI-RP2040-robot/02-assembly) assumes you also have the SmartCar Chassis and a distance sensor.  This section includes labs on using motors, servos and using a distance sensor to create a collision avoidance robot.  There are also advanced labs that integrate a OLED display to allow you to change the parameters of the robot using the buttons.
