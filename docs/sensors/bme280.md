# BME280 Environmental Sensor
The Bosch BME280 is a low-cost ($2) temperature, and pressure sensor that has an I2C interface.  This is an ideal way to learn how to use an I2C interface.

## Circuit

The BME280 has a standard I2C interface with four wires:

* **GND** - connect to any of the GND pins
* **VCC** - connect this to the 3.3V output of the Pico
* **SCL** - clock
* **SDA** - data

## I2C Scanner
After you have connected your sensor you can check the connection by running a quick "I2C Scanner" to find the address of the sensor.

```py
import machine
sda=machine.Pin(0) # This is GP0 on row one of our standard Pico breadboard with the USB on top
scl=machine.Pin(1) # Row two of our standard Pico breadboard
i2c=machine.I2C(0, sda=sda, scl=scl, freq=400000)
print("Device found at decimal", i2c.scan())
```

Results:
```txt
[118]
```

This is decimal of hex 0x76

If the scanner does not return a number then your connections might not be working.

## BME280 Driver
You should be able to find the BME280 driver by using the Thonny **Tool** -> **Manage Packages...** menu.  If that does not work you can try a github search:

[Search GitHub for MBE 280 Python Code](https://github.com/search?q=MBE280+python&type=code)

## Test Code

```python
import machine
from utime import sleep
import BME280
sda=machine.Pin(0) # This is GP0 on row one of our standard Pico breadboard with the USB on top
scl=machine.Pin(1) # Row two of our standard Pico breadboard
i2c=machine.I2C(0, sda=sda, scl=scl, freq=400000)

# initialize the bme class using the default address
bme = BME280()
(chip_id, chip_version) = bme.getID()
print( "Chip ID:", chip_id)
print( "Version:", chip_version)

while True():
    # get new data from the 
    temperature,pressure,humidity = bme.getData()
    #adj_bar = bme.adj_baro(pressure, temperature)
    print("Adj {}".format(bme.adj_baro(pressure, temperature)))

    print( "Temperature: {}C".format(temperature))
    print( "Pressure: {}hpa, {}In".format(pressure, round(pressure * 0.02953, 2)))

    sleep(1)
```
