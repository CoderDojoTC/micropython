# Learning Concept Enumeration

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
Raspberry Pi Pico, and solderless breadboards.
In our labs, we also use many parts such as photosensors, potentiometers, LEDs, resistors, transistors, time-0f-flight sensors, WS2812B LED strips, 128x64 OLED displays, motors, and the Cytron Maker Pi RP2040, which has the same RP2040 microcontroller.

We have a lot of material and lesson plans right now, but I would like an overall list of the 200 key concepts we need to cover in this course.

For this course, please create a list of the core learning concepts that we need to present in this course and the order in which they should be taught.

Please create a list of the 200 most essential concepts
in this course. 
Return the concept's preferred label in a numbered list for each learning concept.
Make sure that the concept names are distinct and not synonyms.  Don't repeat

Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then
proceed to the most complex concepts. Return just one concept label per line.
Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations.
