# Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 Collision Avoidance Robot

We have been working on designing a run robot that can be used to teach computational thinking since 2014.  We have gone through many generations, and now we think we have a fantastic design that is powerful, flexible, extendible and inexpensive.  We love this robot because:

1. The cost of parts is under $20.00 US
2. It is programmed with Python
3. It has plenty of power - with 264K RAM it has the ability to run complex programs
4. The design is flexible and it is easy to add displays and other sensors

## Base Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 Robot Kit

This version uses the time-of-flight sensor.

The robot can be built ia a few hours using a screwdriver and soldering four wires onto the motors.
