# Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 Collision Avoidance Robot

We have been working on designing a run robot that can be used to teach computational thinking since 2014.  We have gone through many generations, and now we think we have a fantastic design that is powerful, flexible, extendible and inexpensive.

This $20 robot kit allows you to create a collision avoidance robot using about $20 of parts or $40 if you use the larger OLED display.

The robot can be built ia a few hours using a screwdriver and soldering four wires onto the motors.
