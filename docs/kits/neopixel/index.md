# NeoPixel Kit

![NeoPixel Kit](../../img/neopixel-kit.jpg)

This is a low-cost (under $10) kit that we use in many of our classes.  It contains the following parts:

1. Raspberry Pi Pico ($4)
2. 1/2 size breadboard ($2)
3. LED Strip (WS2811b) ($3) - these come in many lengths from 8 to 60 pixels
4. Two momentary push buttons (20 cents)
5. USB cable (Micro-B to A)

These lessons will assume you have these parts and can connect up to the Pico to your laptop using a USB cable.  If you have a Mac with a USB-C connector you may need to provide a [USB-C to USB-A adaptor](https://www.amazon.com/Syntech-Adapter-Thunderbolt-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B07CVX3516).

## Sample Labs

We start with the sample code in the [Basics/NeoPixel](../../basics/05-neopixel.md) area.

We then show how you can load full programs.  Here is the source code:
