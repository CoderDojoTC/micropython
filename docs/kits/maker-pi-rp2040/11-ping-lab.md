# Ultrasonic Ping Sensor Lab

The Grove sensors on our Maker Pi RP2040 only supply 3.3 volts.  So the standard very popular low cost HC-SR04 will not work, since it requires 5 volts of power.  We have two options.  One is to get a separate 5V power source, but the other is to purchase the new HC-SR04**P** (for Pico?) sensor that will work with our 3.3 volt power on our Grove connector.
