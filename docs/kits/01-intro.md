# Kits for Learning MicroPython

This section review several kits for learning MicroPython.  Most of them use the RP2040 chip, but there are some that also use the ESP32 when wireless communication is needed.

## Solderless Connectors

There are several types of solderless connectors used in these kits.  They connect sensors and motors to these kits without the need for soldering.  They are ideal for student labs that don't want the fire-hazards associated with soldering or where solderless breadboards and hot-glue is not flexible enough.

These are usually 3 and 4-wire connectors that support analog and digital input and output as well as I2C bus and UART communications.  They are typically designed to carry about 1 amp of current.

* [Grove Connectors](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) - popular with Seeed and Cyton kits.  See the manual [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/document/pdf/Introduction%20to%20Grove.pdf)
* [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) - SparkFun I2C connector
* [Stemma and Stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) - Adafruit connectors are built around standard [JST PH 2mm](https://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199) spacing connectors.

## Example Kits

The following list is not design to be an exhaustive list of all MicroPython development kits available on the market.  We focus on value-based kits that will help our students have fun learning computational thinking.

* Basic Kit - Our standard labs use a $4 Raspberry Pi Pico on a $2 solderless breadboard.  You will also need some 22-gauge wire or a jumper wire kit.
* [Maker Pi RP2040 Kit](maker-pi-rp2040/01-intro.md) - this is a $9.90 kit from Cytron that features a single board with many features for small robots.  It is an ideal low-cost starter kit.

## Searching SparkFun

You can also use the MicroPython "tag" to search all the kits on the SparkFun site:
