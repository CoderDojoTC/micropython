# About MicroPython for Kids

The this site provides a rich collection of resources to teach computational thinking to students from 10 to 16 years old using fun Python programs that control the physical world around us.

The sub-field of computer science that reads sensors and controls lights and motors is called [Physical Computing](../misc/glossary#phyical-computing).  We cover physical computing in our [next section](./02-physical-computing.md).
