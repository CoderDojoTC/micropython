# Breadboards

![Solderless Mini Breadboard](../img/solderless-mini-breadboard.jpg)

We use standard solderless mini breadboards in our labs.  The breadboards have holes that are spaced 1/10th of an inch apart which is a standard for most electronics in the US.

Our breadboards are usually 1/2 size with 400-ties.  They have a central trough and power rails on the left and right edges.
