# Machine Learning on the Raspberry Pi RP2040

*The RP2040 is ready for machine learning. Are You?*

Python is the primary language used in machine learning.  The TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) machine learning library has already been ported to the RP2040 chip.

Utronics has created a machine learning development board with a small QVGA monochrome Camera Module has already been built-in to a RP2040 development board.

We have already seen applications that can use low-resolution cameras to detect faces.
