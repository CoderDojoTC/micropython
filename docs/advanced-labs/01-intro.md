# Advanced MicroPython Labs

These labs are for advanced students that have already mastered the basic of MicroPython programming and want to explore advanced topics.  Advanced Topics Include:

1. [**Interrupt Handlers**](02-interrupt-handlers) - how to get you device to call a function when an external event occurs without doing polling.
1. **Multicore Progamming** - how to get programs running on multiple cores.

2. **Programmable I/O** - The Raspberry Pi includes Programmable I/O devices that allow input and output operations without interrupting the main cores.  The Pico has two PIO blocks that each have four state machines.  Each of these machines can be working independently of the main core processors.
