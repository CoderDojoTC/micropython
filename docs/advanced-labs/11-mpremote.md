# MicroPython Remote

MicroPython now has a standard format for all remote access.  The program
is called [mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html)

The full list of supported commands are:

1. connect
1. disconnect
1. resume
1. soft_reset
1. repl
1. eval
1. exec
1. run
1. fs - file system commands like copy, move, rename
1. df
1. edit
1. mip
1. mount
1. unmount
1. rtc
1. sleep
1. reset
1. bootloader

## Installing

The first time:

```sh
pip install --user mpremote
```

```sh
pip install --upgrade --user mpremote
```

### Install Log

I use conda and you can see that it found the mpremote package version 1.20.0

## Testing the Version

The version of mpremote is not yet working, but eventually, it will be used like this:

```sh
$ mpremote --version
```

```
mpremote 0.0.0-unknown
```

## Getting Help

```sh
$ mpremote --help
```

  devs        list available serial ports
  df          
  ls          
  mkdir       
  reset       reset the device after delay
  rm          
  rmdir       
  setrtc      
  touch       
  u0          connect to serial port "/dev/ttyUSB0"
  u1          connect to serial port "/dev/ttyUSB1"
  u2          connect to serial port "/dev/ttyUSB2"
  u3          connect to serial port "/dev/ttyUSB3"```
```

## Examples of File System Commands

Here is the syntax of the copy file command:

```sh
mpremote fs cp main.py :main.py
```

This copies the local file "main.py" to your pico.  The colon ":" is the root of the pico.

### Setting Up a UNIX Alias

If you get tired of typing "mpremote fs cp" you can create an command-line alias called "pcp" for Pico Copy:

```sh
alias pcp='mpremote fs cp'
```

The copy command the becomes simply:

```sh
pcp main.py :main.py
```

If you place this line in your .bashrc or similar shell startup it saves you a lot of typing.

File systems examples include:

1. ```cat <file..>``` to show the contents of a file or files on the device
2. ```ls``` to list the current directory
3. ```ls <dirs...>``` to list the given directories
4. ```cp [-r] <src...> <dest>``` to copy files
5. ```rm <src...>``` to remove files on the device
6. ```mkdir <dirs...>``` to create directories on the device
7. ```rmdir <dirs...>``` to remove directories on the device
8. ```touch <file..>``` to create the files (if they donâ€™t already exist)

## Creating Deployment Scripts

For large classrooms that teach MicroPython using kits, we recommend that you arrange
all the ```mkdir``` and copy (```cp```) file shell commands in a single UNIX shell script for consistency.

Here are the steps:

1. Update the Pico with a new image
2. Rename the image to be a file system such as '/pico' by copying the 
3. Make a /lib directory
4. Copy all the drivers for your projects to /lib directory
5. Copy the default startup program to the /main.py
6. Have a sequence of "labs" that start with numbers such as 01_blink.py, 02_button.py etc.

If you follow these steps, then when the students connect to the Pico using Thonny they will see all the labs in the right order from simple to the most complex.
