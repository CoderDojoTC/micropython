This GitHub repository is for sharing teaching resources to teach Micropython to students in 5th to 12th grades (10-18 years old).  The course assumes that either a mentor, teacher or students have access to at least one microcontroller such as the $4 Raspberry Pi Pico or the $6 ESP32.  Students should also have access to some low-cost sensors (buttons, potentiometers, ultrasonic distance sensor) and displays such as LEDs or OLED.

## Course Outline

1. [Introduction](01-intro.md) - Overview of Micropython and why we love it.
4. [Boards](02-boards.md) - Description of popular development boards that support Micropython (Pico and ESP32).  How to choose the right microcontroller for your project.
3. [Raspberry Pi Pico](02-pi-pico.md) - Details the Raspberry Pi Pico including features and pinouts.
4. [Thonny IDE](02c-thonny.md) - Thonny is an IDE that supports Micropython.  We review the parts of the User interface.
5. [Blink](03-blink.md) - Blink an LED on and off.  This is the equivalent of the "Hello World!" program in micropython.
7. [Button](03-button.md) - see how a button can control the LED.
6. [Servo](04-servo.md) - Move a Servo.
