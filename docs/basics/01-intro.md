# Introduction to MicroPython

This lesson assumes that you have at least skimmed the [Getting Started](../getting-started/01-intro.md) sections and have selected one of the MicroPython IDEs to write your code.

The lesson will introduce you to the basic concepts of using MicroPython using the $4 Raspberry Pi Pico or a similar microcontroller.

The first two examples just use the Raspberry Pi Pico and don't require a breadboard or wiring.  All the subsequent examples will require you to place components on a solderless breadboard.
