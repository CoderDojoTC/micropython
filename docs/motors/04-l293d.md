## What is an H-Bridge?

## The L293D Circuit

The L293D motor driver IC has two power input pins viz. ‘Vcc1’ and ‘Vcc2’.

Vcc1 is used for driving the internal logic circuitry which should be 5V.

From Vcc2 pin the H-Bridge gets its power for driving the motors which can be 4.5V to 36V. And they both sink to a common ground named GND.
