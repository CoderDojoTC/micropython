# CoderDojo MicroPython Projects

Projects are groups lesson plans that need to work together and frequently build on other projects.  Key project areas include:

1. **Sensors** - find low cost sensors and create a lesson around them
2. **Robot Extensions** - build extensions to our Base robot
3. **Sound and Music** - add labs that generate sound and play music
4. **OLED Displays and Graphics** - leverage the new low-cost OLED displays
5. **Debugging** - build lesson plans to help student learn how to debug MicroPython programs and use logic analyzers
6. **Advanced Labs** - using multiple cores, programming the IP processors, integrating C and assembly code
