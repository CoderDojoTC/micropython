# MicroPython Book Contributing Guide

The goal of this microsite is to provide MicroPython content to STEM educational programs around the world.  We value inclusion and we love low-cost projects that promote STEM instruction in communities that don't have large budgets.  We value a focus on instructional design that teaches computational thinking and uses evidence of the effective delivery of this content to underprivileged communities.

We welcome anyone that would like to add content to this microsite with the following guidelines:

## Ways to Contribute

1. Start out by helping us proof-read our content and help us find typos, spelling, lack-of clarity, and missing content.  As you learn the style of our lessons you will be better able to contribute new lessons that have a similar style
1. You may submit pull requests to this site of if you are not familiar with this process, you can add a link to your content in an issue.
2. You may add an issue to our issues board [here](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/micropython/issues)
3. You are welcome to participate by looking for open tasks and using GitHub workflows to take on tasks to completion.

## Teaching Suggestions

Avoid too much focus on building games that don't promote teaching computational thinking skills.  Simple remote control robots might be fun, but sometime the fun of driving a robot around gets in the way of learning new concepts.

## Lesson Structure

1. Try to begin each section or lesson with a kid-friendly image or video.  This help readers quickly recall if they have visited this page before.
2. If if it not obvious, include any prior knowledge that is required to understand a lesson in an Intended Audience or Prerequsites section.
3. Try to keep the introductory lessons in a section short and small.  After you have introduce the core concepts you can integrate concepts from other areas.
4. Add a "Further Explorations" section to the end of each lesson
Include references to other sites or wikipedia articles that can be explored further.

## Embedding Videos

We strongly encourage some movement in short 10-second demos using videos.

To embed a YouTube video do the following

1. Use the Share button
2. Select the **Embed** option
3. Copy the iFrame code and paste it into your MarkDown
4. Add the ```?rel=0``` link which will only put your own related videos on the More Video when the video is done playing.
