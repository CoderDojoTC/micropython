# Colophon

We are mostly a group of unpaid volunteers without a large budget for distributed content management software.  However, we still want to provide a great user experience for both our mentors and our students.  So we use free open-source tools whenever we can.  Here is how we built this site.

* Our content language is [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
* We use [Python Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) to parse our content.
* We convert Markdown to HTML with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
* Our user interface theme is[Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).  We use an extensive number of Material user interface components.
* Our software version control system is [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Our site is hosted on [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/).
* We use standard code highlighting provided by the mkdocs [codehilite](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/) extension.
* Our BY-NC-SA content license agreement is created by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)

We wish to acknowledge the work of everyone that contributes to open-source projects.  Without these systems this work would not be possible.

If you would like to contribute lesson we welcome your contribution as a git pull request.  You can read our [CoderDojo Twin CitiesAuthoring Guide](https://www.coderdojotc.org/CoderDojoTC/content-authoring-guide/) if you would like to help out.
