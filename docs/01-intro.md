# Welcome to the CoderDojo course on MicroPython

This course is about [MicroPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython), a variation of the popular [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) programming language that is used to program [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller).  

## Intended Audience
* Junior High or High School Students
* Age 10-16

## Preferred Skills
* Familiarity with basic text functions such as Select/ Copy/ Paste
* Basic understanding of Python programming language (_We strongly suggest you take the [Introduction to Python Programming CoderDojo Course](https://www.coderdojotc.org/python/trinket/00-introduction/) if you are not familiar with Python._)

## Course Outline
* [Basics about Micro Controller](introduction/01a-microcontrollers.md)
* [What is Micropython?](docs/introduction/01b-libraries.md)
* Virtual Emulators vs Raspberry Pi Pico
* Setting up Lab environment using Thonny
* Lab exercises - Getting Started 
* Lab exercises - Intermediate
* Lab exercises - Advanced
* Parts & Costs
* Other Boards that can run MicroPython
* Introduction to CircuitPython
#### Intended Audience
Our target audience is students age 10-16 that are in Junior High or High School that have basic keyboarding skills.  For example, students will need to be able to select, copy and paste text from the examples into their own code.

This course is appropriate for students that already have a basic understanding of the Python programming language.  We strongly suggest you take the [Introduction to Python Programming CoderDojo Twin Cities Course](https://www.coderdojotc.org/python/trinket/00-introduction/) if you are not familiar with Python.
