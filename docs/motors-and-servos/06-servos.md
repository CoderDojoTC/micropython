# Controlling a Servo Motor with MicroPython

## Types of Servos

Although there are may types of servos you can purchase, in our labs there are two main types of servos that we use:

1. SG90 Micro Servo, 9 grams, 180 degree, plastic gears - $4
2. MG90S Micro Servo, 9 grams, 180 degree, metal gears - $5

There are other variations that have 360 degree or continuous rotation servos.

## Servo Connections

Almost all servos have a three pin connector that are spaced 1/10th of an inch apart so they will work with our breadboards.

1. Ground (black or brown wire)
2. 5 volt power (always red)
3. Data (orange or yellow)
