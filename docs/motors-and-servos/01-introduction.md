# Using MicroPython to Control Motors and Servos

Controlling motors are one of the funnest ways to learn how to program!  They give us quick hand-on feedback on what are programs are doing.  Motors are used in almost all our robot project.  Robots are used in many STEM courses and coding clubs around the world.  Programs like the AI Racing League allow students to learn topics like Machine Learning, Computer Vision and AI.  These programs all depend on our understanding of how motors work and how to control them.
