# MicroPython Concept Cards
This is a list of concept cards that are related to MicroPython.  Our goal is to print these concept cards on 1/2 sheet laminated paper and have them available at the center of the tables in our CoderDojo Classrooms.

Please let me know if you are willing to volunteer.

Each concept card will have the content stored in a MarkDown file.  A Python script will convert the MarkDown into HTML with a CSS file that paginates the output.
